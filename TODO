TODO:

Whoa, this list would be way to long.
Basically is totally unstable. But sometimes it works ;)

- for sure we need some elegant sorting, it should be possible ot pass comparator in case of native queries
- UUIDs 
- easy way to configure it (activation depth and so on)
- many-to-many relation
- validations
- sorting
- limit/offset ( collection[5..15], collection[5, 10] )
